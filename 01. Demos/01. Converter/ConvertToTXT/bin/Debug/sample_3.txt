If you are looking for secured sharing, keep the file as private and add email addresses of the people you want to share the stuff with. This would share the file only with specific people, and they will have to sign in to their account (Google account) to view the files. All the users you have shared your files with in private mode will be notified my an email regarding the same, and they can then access the files under the shared tab.
